# AI Agent for Visualization Generation

This folder will contain the AI agent implementation that converts user prompts into D3.js visualizations.

## Intended Functionality

1. Receive a user prompt from the backend
2. Analyze the prompt to understand the requested visualization
3. Generate appropriate D3.js code that matches the user's request
4. Return the generated code to the backend

## Current Status

This is a placeholder. The actual AI agent implementation is not included in this repository yet.

In the current implementation, the backend simulates the AI agent's functionality by:

1. Copying an existing visualization template
2. Making simple modifications to match the prompt
3. Saving it as a new file
4. Returning the filename to the frontend

## Future Implementation

The actual AI agent could be implemented using:

- A large language model (LLM) like GPT-4 or Claude
- Fine-tuned models specialized in code generation
- A custom model trained on D3.js visualization examples

For a full implementation, consider:
- Prompt engineering to extract visualization requirements
- Template-based generation with parameter customization
- Data validation and error handling
- Logging for debugging and improvement
